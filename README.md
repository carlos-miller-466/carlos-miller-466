### Hello!

I'm currently learning Rust, C++.

I have knowledge in Python, Lua, Java, and LaTeX.

I use Arch Linux (DWM) and Vim; for work/personal use.

I'd love to collab on any project and bounce ideas around, so feel free to reach out to me through email!
  - *I won't, however, work for free on closed source projects!*
